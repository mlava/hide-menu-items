In the topbar you can choose to hide:
- Page Filter button
- Calendar button
- Three Dot menu button
- Page Width button
- Help button

You can select to Hide on Mobile or Hide on All Platforms. This means you can have different settings for different purposes.

For example, if you want to hide the Help button on mobile only but hide the Calendar button on all platforms, just select Hide on Mobile for Help and Hide on All Platforms for Calendar.

TODO:
1. allow buttons from Roam Depot extensions to be hidden
