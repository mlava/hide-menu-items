In the left sidebar you can choose to hide:
- Daily Notes
- Graph Overview
- All Pages
- Roam Depot

In the topbar you can choose to hide:
- Page Filter button
- Calendar button
- Three Dot menu button
- Page Width button
- Help button

You can choose to hide on mobile only, or across all platforms. Use the 'Mobile or All Platforms' switch to change menus. Note that if you are in the mobile only menu, a change to the items will only be evident when using your graph on a mobile device. If you make a change in the All Platforms menu, that change will be evident on all devices.

You can have specific settings for certain items. For example, if you want to hide the Help button on mobile only but hide the Calendar button on all platforms, just select Help in the mobile menu and Calendar in the all platforms menu.
